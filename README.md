This is my try at Operating Systems and how they work, using C and Assembly

The system consists of simple instructions sent to the processing unit to load the kernel created in C.
Key mappings are defined via scancodes found under \Documentation , allowing identification of keyboard entries.
The system runs simply as a command line operated system, without graphical interface.
